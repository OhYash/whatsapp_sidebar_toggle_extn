# Whatsapp Web sidebar toggle extension

This extension was created to hide/show sidebar on whatsapp. This could be helpful for small/vertical screens.
Existing extensions are available on the chrome webstore. But none of them provide an integrated switch where it belongs, on the side header.
This little code does that.

Very simple extension, does the job in place so it comes off as seamless experience.
